# Password Generator

This project is a simple Python-based password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user preferences for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Features

- **Customizable Passwords:** Choose how many letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password.
- **Randomized Order:** The generated password has a randomized order of characters for added security.
- **Easy to Use:** Command-line interface prompts for user input and displays the generated password.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers to include.
2. It randomly selects the specified number of each character type.
3. The characters are shuffled and combined into a secure password.
4. The final password is displayed in the terminal.
